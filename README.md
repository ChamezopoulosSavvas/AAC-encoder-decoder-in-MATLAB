# AAC-encoder-decoder-in-MATLAB

This is a project developed for the ECE Auth course - Multimedia Systems and Virtual Reality

It is a signal encoder-decoder according to a simplified AAC protocol.

It utilizes the phychoacoustic model as conformity criterion for the quantizer, the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) at the filterbank level, and Huffman encoding for entropy encoding. 

A schematic for the encoder is this:

A scematic for the decoder is this:
